                <p>Projects occur for many reasons: Planned expansions (we are growing …) or sudden change (fire, flood or exuberant neighbors!). Their successful conclusion often requires managerial, technical and/or resources that may not readily be available within a business team.</p>
                <p>Whether a project is planned or unplanned they all have two thinks in common.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><p>They are defined by the scope of work intended, the time frame in which it needs to be achieved and its budget: The classic Scope, Schedule and Budge.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>They are separate to “business as usual” activities within and organization. They require people, some from outside, to come together to focus on the specific project objectives and their successful conclusion.</p>

                <h5>Our guiding mindset/attitude/approach:</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Get the brief right – know what needs to be achieved</li>
                    <li>Get the Team right – it is as strong as the weakest link</li>
                    <li>Good people do good work - share the vision: Treat them with respect</li>
                    <li>Manage external communications - third parties are involved</li>
                    <li>Seek best value - cheap is not a virtue</li>
                    <li>Use surveys and prototypes early to understand the risks</li>
                    <li>Do not try to dump risk – it will return to haunt you</li>

            <section>
                <p>Strategy requires making explicit choices, to do some things and not others, during the project. Strategy is choice: More specifically, it is an integrated series of choices that direct the project.</p>
                <p>Having a professional on the team who regards this as their day job, assists the remainder of the team who have often been co-opted into the project.</p>
